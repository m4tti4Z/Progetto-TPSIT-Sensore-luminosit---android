SensorMood is a fun Android app that measures the light around you using your phone's sensor and gives instant feedback. It shows the current brightness in lux, changes the background color dynamically, and tells you if your environment is too dark, too bright, or just right. You can also turn on the flashlight to improve lighting and select different scenarios like reading, studying, or night rest to get personalized advice.

The app includes a Game Mode where a random target brightness is generated, and your goal is to adjust your environment to match it. The screen color changes from red to yellow as you get closer to the target, and a timer tracks how long it takes to win. Victory is achieved when your ambient light is within ±15 lux of the target.

Permissions needed: CAMERA for the flashlight and WRITE_SETTINGS for automatic brightness adjustment. Requires a device with a light sensor.

SensorMood is perfect for checking your lighting, training your eyes, or just having fun trying to match the target lux!
